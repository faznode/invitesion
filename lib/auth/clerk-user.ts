/**
 * The only bridge between Clerk and this application's identity.
 *
 * Clerk owns credentials, sessions, password reset, email verification, and
 * social sign-in. It does not own *identity*: `invitations`, `orders`, `guests`
 * and the rest reference `users.id` as an integer, and rewriting five foreign
 * keys to carry a `user_xxx` string would be a large migration bought for
 * nothing.
 *
 * So a Clerk account is resolved to a local row here and nowhere else. Every
 * caller keeps using `getUser()` and receives the same local `User` it always
 * did — which is why adopting Clerk touched five files instead of the
 * thirty-nine that call it.

 * arrive after the user's first request, which would mean a signed-in customer
 * briefly having no local row and every ownership check failing. Doing it on the
 * request that needs it makes that race impossible.
 *
 * Returns null when nobody is signed in.
