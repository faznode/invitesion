 * shown and the way it is charged can never disagree.
 *
 * These figures were previously inlined in the customer theme catalog, and the
 * marketing pricing page separately advertised "Rp0 / GRATIS". Whoever settles
 * that conflict changes the constants here (or moves them to the database), and
 * does not re-scatter literals across components.
 *
 * Amounts are integer minor units: whole rupiah for IDR, cents for USD.
