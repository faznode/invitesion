## 1. Stack [OBSERVED package.json, configs]
| Layer | Today | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15.6.0-canary.59, App Router, Turbopack dev; `experimental.ppr` + `clientSegmentCache` | Canary in production is a risk (no LTS patches) |
| UI | React 19.1.4, Tailwind 4.1.7, Radix/shadcn primitives, lucide icons, CSS Modules on marketing pages | No animation library, no `next/image` |
| Data | PostgreSQL via postgres.js (pool `max` 10, `POSTGRES_POOL_MAX`) + Drizzle ORM 0.43 | 18 tables, 9 migrations |
| Auth | Clerk 7 (`@clerk/nextjs`), local `users` row mapped by `clerk_user_id`; roles in DB | ClerkProvider wraps the root layout, so guest pages also load clerk-js |
| Payments | QRIS (own EMVCo payload + provider adapter) and Stripe (REST + own signature check) | No SDKs; idempotent settlement |
| Storage | Local disk (dev) / S3-compatible (prod) with own SigV4 | Originals only, no image pipeline |
| Validation | Zod 3 (`detailConfigSchema`, strict) | — |
| Tests | node:test via tsx, 49 cases | No CI in the repo (`.github/` absent) |
| Hosting (inferred) | Vercel: `vercel-build` runs migrations + template seed on production builds; middleware reads `x-vercel-ip-country` | [INFERRED high] |

## 2. Runtime shape
- **Rendering:** every customer and guest page is server-rendered on demand. Guest pages declare `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; with PPR the static shell is prerendered and the body streams (`x-nextjs-postponed: 1`) [OBSERVED H-INV-001].
- **Mutations:** Server Actions with Post/Redirect/Get for guest RSVP and wishes; Route Handlers for JSON APIs (detail PATCH, media, upload, payment webhooks, user).
- **Middleware (Node runtime) on every non-static request:** Clerk session resolution, protected-route redirects, locale resolution, per-request CSP nonce (report-only), and `Set-Cookie: locale=…` on every response.
- **Background work:** none besides `after()` view tracking. No queue, no scheduler, no worker (Redis/BullMQ planned, not present).

## 4. Guest read path (the hot path)
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Guest browser
  participant M as middleware
  participant P as /i/:slug/:guest
  participant D as Postgres
  B->>M: GET /i/budi-sari/budi-hartono
  M->>M: clerkMiddleware (signed-out), locale, nonce
  M->>P: request + CSP header
  P->>D: generateMetadata → loadPublicInvitation (invitation, guest, media‖wishes‖count)
  P->>D: page → loadPublicInvitation again (same 5 queries, no cache())
  P-->>B: HTML + RSC payload (no-store, Set-Cookie: locale)
  P->>D: after(): dedupe SELECT on analytics_events, INSERT, UPDATE guests
```
**Cost per guest open [OBSERVED code M-012]:** 5 queries for metadata + 5 for the page (3 sequential rounds each) + 3 for tracking = **13 queries**, none cacheable at the CDN because the response is `private, no-store` and sets a cookie. The `analytics_events` dedupe query has no supporting index (data-model.md §5), so its cost grows with total platform traffic, not per invitation.

Local measurement (C-INV-001, production build, Lighthouse mobile Slow-4G + 4× CPU): Performance 94, LCP 2.6 s, TBT 186 ms, CLS 0, 19 requests / 323 KB transferred **excluding clerk-js** (+70.7 KB brotli in production; DNS-blocked in the sandbox) [OBSERVED C-INV-001, H-INV-004]. Server TTFB on localhost 5–10 ms with a warm pool [OBSERVED H-INV-001]; the realistic risk is pool exhaustion (10 connections × instances) during a WhatsApp blast, not single-request latency. Load numbers: Phase 8 spike.

## 5. Guest write path
`submitRsvp` / `submitGuestMessage` → re-resolve invitation + guest (2 queries) → UPDATE/INSERT + analytics INSERT → `revalidatePath` → 303 redirect → full page re-render (another 13 queries). No rate limit, no idempotency key, no CSRF token beyond Server Action origin checks.

## 6. Creator path
```mermaid

  U --> T[Pick template /templates or /dashboard/templates]
  T --> CR["createInvitation → DRAFT<br/>(defaultConfig parse fails → {} — QA-001)"]
  CR --> E[Form editor: 16 modules, manual save, PATCH /api/.../detail → version row]
  E --> GU[Add guests one by one]
  E --> CO[Checkout: QRIS or Stripe]
  CO --> W[Webhook → order PAID]
  W --> PB[Publish: name + dated event + paid → PUBLISHED, expires +12 months]
  PB --> SH[Share: per-guest wa.me deep links, manual]
```

## 7. Deployment notes
- Production build runs `db:migrate` and `db:seed:templates` inside `vercel-build` (schema changes ship with every deploy; a failing migration fails the deploy) [OBSERVED package.json].
- `pnpm build` requires `POSTGRES_URL` because a route evaluates the DB client during page-data collection [OBSERVED setup-log].
- Security headers in `next.config.ts` (nosniff, SAMEORIGIN, referrer policy, permissions policy, HSTS); CSP is per-request in middleware and report-only (`CSP_ENFORCE` flag).
- No observability stack (no tracing, no error tracker, no uptime checks) in the repo [OBSERVED].
