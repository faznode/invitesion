/**
 * Settlement webhook.
 *
 * **This is the source of truth for payment, not the browser redirect.** A
 * customer who pays and immediately closes the tab must still end up with a paid
 * order; a customer who merely loads the success URL must not.
 *
 * Three properties this handler has to get right:
 *
 *  1. **Raw body.** The signature covers the exact bytes sent. Reading `.json()`
 *     first and re-serialising changes whitespace and key order and invalidates
 *     it, so the body is read as text and parsed only after verification.
 *  2. **Status codes decide retries.** A provider retries on non-2xx. So a
 *     verification failure is 400 (never retry — it will never become valid), a
 *     duplicate is 200 (stop retrying, already done), and only a genuine
 *     server-side fault is 500 (please retry).
 *  3. **No authentication of its own.** The signature *is* the authentication.
 *     There is no session here, which is why `/api` is excluded from the
 *     session middleware.
